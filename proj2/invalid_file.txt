This is one of the very large number of ways that a file might contain invalid data.
Be sure you test for the different possibilities.
A good approach: Create a correct save file, verify that it restores correctly.
Then make several copies. 
The use a text editor to damage each copy by making a small alteration to the data,
for example, by deleting a line from the middle of the file. Then test to see
if your program detects an invalid data condition. Compare with the project specifications.
