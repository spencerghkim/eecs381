/* *** View class ***
The View class encapsulates the data and functions needed to generate the map
display, and control its properties. It has a "memory" for the names and locations
of the to-be-plotted objects.

Usage: 
1. Call the update_location function with the name and position of each object
to be plotted. If the object is not already in the View's memory, it will be added
along with its location. If it is already present, its location will be set to the 
supplied location. If a single object changes location, its location can be separately
updated with a call to update_location. 
2. Call the update_remove function with the name of any object that should no longer
be plotted. This must be done *after* any call to update_location that 
has the same object name since update_location will add any object name supplied.
3. Call the draw function to print out the map. 
4. As needed, change the origin, scale, or displayed size of the map 
with the appropriate functions. Since the view "remembers" the previously updated
information, immediately calling the draw function will print out a map showing the previous objects
using the new settings.
