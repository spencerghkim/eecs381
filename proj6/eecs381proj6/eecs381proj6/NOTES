TODO:

Check that all dtors are correct (dont wanna lose dumb points)
Move Classes into their own files! (no longer need to squish them right?)

Make sure makefile/.cpp's dont have excessive dependancies

Notes:

Moved to
    using Type = enum {...};
From:
    typedef enum {...} Type; // I think this is C++11


File Origins:
    MVC all came from Otto's PA5
